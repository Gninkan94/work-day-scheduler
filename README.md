# work-day-scheduler

## Description

This is a work day scheduler to help employees with a busy schedule to manage successfully their day to day job! I used color to differentiate the moment the red color means past, the yellow is the current hour and the green is the futur time.
when you click on save buttun it will display "your entry has been saved" and at the bottom of the page it will display "made with some love by Ibrahima Diallo" I love this feature. It display the current Date & Time on the page.
